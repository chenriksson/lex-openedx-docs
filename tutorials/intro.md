##File System:
    * File encoding: UTF-8 (Windows Unicode is UTF-16LE)
    * EOL delimiter: '\n' (Windows EOL is '\r\n')
    * Path delimiter: '/'
        * Note drive format for Git-Bash paths: "/c/Windows"
    * System directories:
        * /bin - common executables
        * /etc - system configuration files
        * /home - home directories
        * /root - administrative user's home
        * /tmp - temporary space, cleaned on reboot
        * /usr - programs, libraries, documentation
        * /var - storage for variable, temporary files (logs, mail queue, downloads, etc)
    * Permissions:
        * Symbolic notation: "-rwx|rwx|rwx"
            * '-' is file type. '-' for regular file, 'd' for directory, 'l' for symbolic link, etc.
            * 'rwx' denotes read, write, execute permissions
            * Permission triads are: owner|group|others
        * Numeric notation: (octal)
            * `stat -c %a {file}` to see numeric
            * Each digit is sum of its component bits
                * Binary: 100=read, 010=write, 001=execute
                * e.g.: 7=rwx, 6=rw, 5=rx, 4=r, 3=wx, 2=w, 1=x
                * e.g.: 777=rwx for everyone; 744=rwx for owner and r for everyone
    * Editors:
        * Nano (easier)
        * Vi (more powerful)
        * Notepad++ (SFTP) (remote)
    
Shell / Environment
    * (GNU) Bash is the default for Ubuntu, Git for Windows
        â—‹ i.e., versus Bourne (sh), Korn (ksh), C (csh), etc
    * Common variables
        * $USER
        * $PATH, $MANPATH
        * $SHELL
    * Profile
        * ~/.bash_profile

System Logging (SysLog)
    * Configuration:
        * Primary config: /etc/rsyslog.conf
        * Program config files: /etc/rsyslog.d
